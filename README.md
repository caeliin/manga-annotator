# manga-annotator
I translate manga in my spare time. I'm tired of typing things like "other other girl left small text", so I'm writing a program to translate visually.

This program loads loose (non-zipped) manga files in a folder and allows placing of translations on the image by position. Translations are saved in the same folder as the images.
